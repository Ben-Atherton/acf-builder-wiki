# ACF Builder Documentation
[ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) is an indispensable tool for creating powerful admin interfaces for WordPress. Best $100 AUD you'll ever spend. It even has a great admin interface for creating the custom fields. And while the admin interface is great for beginners, as you start to add more developers, source control, and more and more fields, it starts to become a little cumbersome. So ACF has the ability to [register fields directly in your php code](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/register-fields-via-php/). It also describes all the default value for each field. The main problem is the array syntax used can be very verbose making it hard to get a birds eye view, and can be error prone. This is what the ACF Builder hopes to solve, along with making fields groups composable of other field groups.
